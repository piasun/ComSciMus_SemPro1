                            museum, teach them in our learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations 
                            that will excite and inspire them.</p>

                    <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good

                    <p>Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a 
                        working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff 
                        and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for 
                        the museum.
                        </p>
                    <p>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. 
                        Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.
